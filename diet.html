            <h2>Diet</h2>
            <p>Otters are carnivorous and have diets primarily made up of fish, but they also consume a variety of other aquatic animals depending on their habitat, species, and food availability!
        <ul>
            <li> 1. River Otters: River otters primarily eat fish, but they also enjoy amphibians, crayfish, small mammals, birds, even aquatic plants! Theyâ€™re skilled hunters who rely on their sharp eyesight and agile bodies to catch fish in quick bursts when underwater.</li>
                
            <li>   2. Sea Otters: Sea otters mainly consume marine invertebrates.
                - Sea otters are also famous for their use of rocks as tools! They use them to crack open hard-shelled prey, often placing the rock on their chest and striking the shell against it. How smart! </li>
                
            <li>   3. Giant Otters: Giant otters have a diet rich in fish, especially catfish and piranhas. Small caimans, crustaceans, and even small snakes.
                - Social Hunting: These otters sometimes hunt cooperatively in family groups, allowing them to take down larger prey. </li>
                
            <li>  4. Smooth-Coated Otters: Smooth-coated otters feed mostly on fish but will also consume frogs, insects, and small reptiles.
                - Adaptability: They often live near human settlements and may even hunt in rice paddies or irrigation canals </li>
                </ul>

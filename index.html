            <p>Think of an animal that spends the majority of their time in the water, extremely social, and has an insatiable curiosity. Meet the otter! Known to be extremely playful animals, amazing swim skills, and who are big time fish lovers! Otters have thick, brown, waterproof fur and webbed feet.
